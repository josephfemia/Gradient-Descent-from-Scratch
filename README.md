# Gradient Descent From Scratch

This notebook aims to walk someone through the concept of Gradient Descent. The Notebook uses a Linear Regression model to optimize, however gradient descent can be applied to multiple different areas of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. All of this information as to how the algorithm is working is provided by the comments. I also tried to make the code as user friendly as possible. If you have any questions feel free to open any issues, I will tend to them as soon as I see them. Thank you!!

## How to install and run the notebook
This project was made using [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for keeping track of dependencies. First you must have Pipenv installed:
```
pip install pipenv
```
After having Pipenv installed, you should create a virutalenv for the project. To do this, cd into the directory and run the command:
```
pipenv shell
```
Finally, to install the necessary dependencies run:
```
pipenv install
```
By calling ```pipenv install``` you install all of the necessary dependencies within the Pipfile.lock.

All that is needed to run the notebook now is just run the command below and check oyur browser instance for a new Jupyter Notebook tab:
```
jupyter notebook
```
